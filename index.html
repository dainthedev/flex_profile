        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love the infinite possibilities of apps, programming and web design. I love that with minimal resources, anyone can make something that has an impact. That is what has drawn me to this field. I want to make things that matter and do so with people who care equally about producing valuable content.</p>
        
        <p>Our world is simulataneously bigger and smaller. Our technological prowess makes the traversal of formerly unreachable destinations a possiblilty expanding our reach from the oceans depths to the stars. The vastness of the universe shrinks with every new accomplishment, but it is these very achivements that make the our universe all the richer. The swaths of tools and consumables at our disposal is breathtaking in the same way that the vastness of the uncharted seas was for our ancestors. There are some who say there are no more frontiers, but I say the greatest frontier has always been our own imagination and that is without limit. This is what I want to be a part of.</p>
